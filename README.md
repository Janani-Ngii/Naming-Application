## Description
<p> THis program allows one to generate their name aftre inputting their DOB. 
  The landing page has a description of the application.
  On the Generate-Name tag, the user is then able to input their gender and date of birth and consequently get an Akan name 
  based on that information.
  The application does not give back any information if the date of birth information is blank. </p>
## Installation

* Internet access
* One also has to be conversant with using a computer. the website can be accessed  through clicking on the link provided on my github page 
* (https://github.com/Janani-Ngii/Naming-Application). this will take one straight to the landing page. they can then navigate though to the generate
* name tag on the navigation bar to help them generate their names. Not inputting a date will render the result invalid and prompt the user to do that.

### Installation Process
The application is currently a web application and is accessible on phone and on a computer using a browser.
It is only accessible from my github page at the moment.
